## Introduction
This repository contains for an email proccessing Transformer, based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language model. The model, based on the attention architecture, attempts to classify legitimate emails from malicious phishing attempts, and can be used as an additional layer of protection against these types of attacks.

This project was written as part of the [Technion's ECE Deep Learning course (046211)](https://taldatech.github.io/ee046211-deep-learning/).

We've used [this Kaggle database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset) as a baseline for performance - it contains 82k emails with roughly equal amounts of legitimate and phishing/spam emails.

A short video summarizing the project can be found here - FIXME

FIXME - maybe add highlighting important passages?

## How to run

FIXME add code example


## Performance
add FIXME:
1. confusion matrix
2. val/train/test results
3. graphs
